## üöÄ Apache Airflow DAGs: Learn to Orchestrate Your Data Workflows

Welcome to the `learn-airflow-dags` repository! This repository is your essential companion for mastering Apache Airflow DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs), from fundamental concepts to advanced patterns. It hosts all the code examples, practical demonstrations, and starter templates used in our comprehensive YouTube video series and detailed documentation website.

Whether you're new to data orchestration or looking to deepen your Airflow knowledge, this repository provides hands-on code to accelerate your learning journey.

### ‚ú® What You'll Find Here

This repository is structured to mirror our learning path, making it easy to find the code relevant to each tutorial:

* **`Dags/Basics/`**: Get started with core Airflow concepts. This section contains:
    * Your very first "Hello World" DAG.
    * Examples demonstrating various operators (e.g., `BashOperator`, `PythonOperator`).
    * How to define task dependencies and control workflow flow.
    * ...and more foundational examples as the series progresses!
* **`Dags/Advanced/`**: (Coming Soon!) Dive into more complex Airflow features, including XComs, branching, sensors, and dynamic DAG generation.
* **`Dags/CICD/`**: (Coming Soon!) Explore best practices for continuous integration and deployment of your Airflow DAGs.
* **`utils/`**: Helper scripts or shared modules if applicable to your DAGs.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started with the Code

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/shantanukhond/learn-airflow-dags.git](https://github.com/shantanukhond/learn-airflow-dags.git)
    cd learn-airflow-dags
    ```
2.  **Ensure Airflow is Running:** Make sure you have an Apache Airflow environment set up (e.g., via Docker Compose or pip). Refer to our [Installation Guide on the documentation website](https://airflow.atwish.org/docs/Installation/PiPy) if you need help.
3.  **Place DAGs:** Copy the `.py` or `.mdx` DAG files from the relevant subdirectories (e.g., `Dags/Basics/`) into your Airflow's `dags` folder.
4.  **Explore!** Open your Airflow UI and watch your new DAGs appear.
